- #Latency is the time it takes for a message, or a packet, to travel from its point of origin to the point of destination.
- Common types of delays that causes the packet to slow down are
	- **Propagation delay** which is the amount of time for a message to travel from the sender to the receiver. This equals to $distance / propagation speed$
	- **Transmission delay** is the amount of time required to push all packet's bits into the link. Here the packet's length and data rate
