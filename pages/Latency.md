- #Latency is the time it takes for a message, or a packet, to travel from its point of origin to the point of destination.
- The total latency between two machines is the sum of all the following delays
	- **Propagation delay** is the amount of time required for a message to travel from the sender to the receiver. This equals to distance between two machines over propagation speed of the signal (data-rate).
	- **Transmission delay** is the amount of time required to push all packet's bits into the link. Here the packet's length and data rate comes into play
	- **Processing delay** is the amount of time required to process the packet header, check for bit-level errors, and determine the packet's destination
	- **Queuing delay** is the amount of time the packet is waiting in the queue until it can be processed
