- # Diffie-Hellman
	- The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is a mathematical method of securely creating a shared secret (most often a symmetric encryption key) between two clients over an insecure/public channel by using public and private variables.
	- This method is widely used such as in [[SSH]], [[TLS]], [[SSL]] and most end-to-end encryption protocols
	- ## Description
	- Given two parties, Alice and Bob, both of which have a secret component (Alice -> a, Bob -> b) and a public components (p). For simplicity we use colours for this variables. Alice and Bob both create a mixture with their secret component and the public component ()
