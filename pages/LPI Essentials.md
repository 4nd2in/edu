##  Linux Evolution and Popular Operating Systems
collapsed:: true
	- #### 1. How is Debian GNU/Linux different from Ubuntu? Name two aspects.
		- Debians main goal is stability and reliability. Therefore Debian receives fewer updates compared to Ubuntu.
		- The goal of Ubuntu is ease of use which is why it is better for beginners. Debian is used by more advances users.
	- #### 2. What are the most common environments/platforms Linux is used for? Name three different environments/platforms and name one distribution you can use for each.
		- Servers -> Debian
		- Embedded Systems -> Android
		- Desktops -> Ubuntu
	- #### 3. You are planning to install a Linux distribution in a new environment. Name four things that you should consider when choosing a distribution.
		- Which environment/platform do I run?
		- How reliable should it be?
		- Must I support specific hardware?
		- Do I need newest features?
	- #### 4. Name three devices that the Android OS runs on, other than smartphones.
		- TVs
		- Smartwatches
	- #### 5. Explain three major advantages of cloud computing.
		- The end user does not need a powerful machine and only pays what he actually needs.
		- Cloud services can easily be scaled up and down based on usage.
		- Backup and recovery can be handled by the cloud provider. This makes it a lot easier for the user to recover from
	- #### 6. Considering cost and performance, which distributions are mostly suitable for a business that aims to reduce licensing costs, while keeping performance at its highest? Explain why.
		- To reduce licensing costs, choosing an open license is most suitable as it does not cost anything to use the product. To keep up with performance the distribution should provide frequent updates and should be easy to use. Considering this points I suggest Ubuntu, CentOS and OpenSUSE. The Advantage of CentOS over the other two is that it incorporates all Red Hat products, which are further used within their commercial operating system.
	- #### 7. What are the major advantages of the Raspberry Pi and which functions can they take in business?
		- In comparison with normal computers, a Raspberry Pi has very low costs. Its performance is good enough so that it can be used for simple desktop tasks. Because the Raspberry Pi is able to use GPIO businesses can use a Raspberry Pi to use it to test hardware or produce simple prototypes for embedded systems.
	- #### 8. What range of distributions does Amazon Cloud Services and Google Cloud offer? Name at least three common ones and two different ones
		- The common distributions between Amazon and Google Cloud Services are Ubuntu, CentOS
		  and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Each cloud provider also offers specific distributions that the
		  other one doesn’t. Amazon has Amazon Linux and Kali Linux, while Google offers the use of
		  FreeBSD and Windows Servers.

- ## Open Source Software and Licensing
  collapsed:: true
	- #### 1. What are — in a nutshell — the “four freedoms” as defined by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation?
		- Freedom to run the software
		- Freedom to study and modify the software
		- Freedom to distribute the software
		- Freedom to distribute the modified software
	- #### 2. You have written a web application and published it under a free license. How can you earn money with your product? Name three possibilities.
		- _Software as a Service_: Run the software on own servers and allow customers to use it by paying a fee.
		- _Dual Licensing_: Provide a free tier (e.g for individuals) and a tier that enables advanced features (e.g for businesses) for a fee.
		- _Crowdfunding_: Allow users to donate to you.
- ## ICT Skills and Working in Linux

	- Another way to secure your communication is to sign and encrypt your files folders and emails with GnuPG. dm-crypt and EncFS are two alternatives to encrypt whole disks or partitions that use respectively block and stack encryption methods.
	- Finally, LibreOffice Impress is a very complete open source alternative to Microsoft Powerpoint but there are Beamer and RevealJS if you prefer to create presentations using code instead of GUIs. ProjectLibre and GanttProject can be the right choice if you need a Microsoft Project replacement.
