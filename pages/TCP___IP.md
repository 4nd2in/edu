- TCP
	- When you work with a #TCP stream, you are guaranteed that all bytes sent will be identical with bytes received and that they will arrive in the same order to the client. #TCP is optimised for accurate delivery rather than a timely one.
	-
	- #TCP is using a three-way-handshake before sharing any application data
