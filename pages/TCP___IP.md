- TCP
	- When you work with a TCP stream, you are guaranteed that all bytes sent will be identical with bytes received and that they will arrive in the same order to the client. #TCP is optimised for accurate delivery rather than a timely one.
	- TCP uses flags to indicate different states of connectivity
	-
	-
	- #TCP is using a three-way-handshake before sharing any application data

	- Client picks a random sequence number `x` and sends a **SYN** packet, which may also include additional TCP flags and options.
	- Server increments `x` by one, picks own random sequence number `y`, appends its own set of flags and options, and dispatches the response in a **SYN ACK** packet.
	- Client increments both `x` and `y` by one and completes the handshake by dispatching the last **ACK** packet in the handshake.
