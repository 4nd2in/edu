# RFC 2246 - Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	- TLS (formerly known as [[SSL]]) uses a combination of [[symmetric and asymmetric cryptography]] to provide a good compromise between performance and security when transmitting data securely.
	- TLS works on the [application layer]( ((645bb059-accb-4052-951b-6927d78a2919)) ), directly on top of [[TCP]]. This enables protocols above it (HTTP, email, ...) to operate unchanged.
