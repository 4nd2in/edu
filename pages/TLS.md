# RFC 2246 - Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	- TLS (formerly known as [[SSL]]) uses a combination of [[symmetric and asymmetric cryptography]] to provide a good compromise between performance and security when transmitting data securely. Third-party observers can only infer the connection endpoints, type of encryption, as well as the frequency and an approximate amount of data sent. but cannot read or modify any of the actual data.
	- TLS works on the [application layer]( ((645bb059-accb-4052-951b-6927d78a2919)) ), directly on top of [[TCP]]. This enables protocols above it (HTTP, email, ...) to operate unchanged.
	- The protocol is designed to provide three essential services to all applications running above it:
		- Encryption (obfuscate sent data)
			- Both parties must agree which cipher will be used and the keys used to encrypt the data. This happens during the TLS handshake.
		- Authentication (verify validity of identification material)
			- This verification is based on the established chain of trust
		- Integrity (detect tampering and forgery)
			- Sent records are
