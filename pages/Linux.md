# Linux
	- First Version was written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
	- The term Linux is commonly used to refer to the entire #UNIX like operating system of which the Linux #Kernel forms a part. However, this is something of a misnomer, since many of the key components contained within a typical commercial Linux distribution actually originate from a project that predates the inception of Linux by several years.
	- ## Users and Groups
		- ### Users
			- Every user has a unique username and a user ID (UID). For each user, these are defined by a line in the system file `/etc/passwd`:
				- _Group ID_: the numeric ID of the first of the groups of which the user is a member
				- _Home directory_: the initial directory into which the user is placed after logging in
				- _Login shell_: the name of the program to be executed to interpret user commands
		- ### Groups
			- One user can be in multiple groups. Groups are made to easily administrate file access
