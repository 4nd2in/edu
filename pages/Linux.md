# Linux
	- First Version was written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
	- The term Linux is commonly used to refer to the entire #UNIX like operating system of which the Linux #Kernel forms a part. However, this is something of a misnomer, since many of the key components contained within a typical commercial Linux distribution actually originate from a project that predates the inception of Linux by several years.
