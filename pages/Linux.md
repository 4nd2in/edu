# Linux
	- First Version was written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
	- The term Linux is commonly used to refer to the entire #UNIX like operating system of which the Linux #Kernel forms a part. However, this is something of a misnomer, since many of the key components contained within a typical commercial Linux distribution actually originate from a project that predates the inception of Linux by several years.
	- ## Users and Groups
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Users
			- Every user has a unique username and a user ID (UID). For each user, these are defined by a line in the system file `/etc/passwd`:
				- _Username_: the unique name of the user
				- _Password_: was used to store the encrypted password. Modern systems store `x` or `*` here, indicating the password is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file
				- _User ID (UID)_: the numeric ID associated with this user
				- _Group ID_ (GID): the numeric ID of the users primary group. additional groups are stored in the system group file.
				- _Home directory_: the initial directory into which the user is placed after logging in
				- _Login shell_: the name of the program to be executed to interpret user commands
			-
			- The superuser has special privileges in the system. His account has the user ID of 0 and the user name _root_. The superuser bypasses all permission checks in the system.
		- ### Groups
			- One user can be in multiple groups. Groups are made to easily administrate file access for multiple users. Each group is identified by a single line in the system group file `/etc/group`:
				- _Group name_: the unique name of the group
				- _Group ID_: the numeric ID associated with this group
				- _User list_: a comma-separated list of login names of users
	- ## Directories and Files
		- ### Structure
			- #### /bin
				- Binary or executable programs (ps, ls, grep, etc)
			- #### /boot
				- Contains all the boot-related information files and folders (vmlinux, grub, etc)
			- #### /etc
				- System configuration files
			- #### /home
				- Home directories for users
			- #### /lib
				- Contains kernel modules and a shared library files to support programs installed under _/bin_ and _/sbin_
			- #### /media
				- Contains subdirectories where removal media devices are inserted
			- #### /mnt
				- Contains temporary mount directories for mounting the file system
			- #### /opt
				- Optional third party software
			- #### /proc
				- It is a virtual pseudo-file system to contains that contains information about the running processes with a specific process ID (PID)
			- #### /sbin
				- Binary executable programs of the system. Typically used by the superuser (iptables, reboot, etc)
			- #### /srv
				- Contains server-specific and server-related service (srv) files
			- #### / sys
				- It is a virtual file system for modern Linux distributions to store and allows modification of the devices connected to the system
			- #### /tmp
				- Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot
			- #### /usr
				- User related programs
			- #### /var
				- Variable files. Files that are expected to grow like log files.

		- ### File Types
			- _Data files_: Regular or plain files to store data
			- _Directories_: Table of filenames coupled with references to the corresponding file. Contains at least two entries `.` and `..`. The table can contain _links (soft link)_. Links are pointers to a file with an alternative name.
			- _Symbolic Links (hard link)_: Like a link but is a specially marked file containing the name of another file. If the target file of the symbolic link does not exist it is called a _dangling link_
			- _Devices_: Represent device files such as hard drives, monitors, etc
			- _Pipes_: If processes are executed under different user names and permissions, then standard pipes do not work. In such circumstances, pipe files are used. Pipe files are similar to the standard pipes except that they can be accessed as part of the filesystem.
			- _Sockets_: Socket files are the special files that use a file name as their address instead of an IP address and port number. Socket files use the **sendmsg()** and **recvmsg()** system calls to enable inter-process communication between local applications
		- ### File ownership and permission
			- Each file has an associated user ID and group ID that define the owner of the file and the group to which it belongs. The ownership of a file is used to determine the access rights available to users of the file.
			- There are three categories of file access:
				- _owner_: user
				- _group_:  users of the group which owns the file
				- _other_: other users that do not match the previous two categories
			- Three permissions can be set for each of this categories: _read_, _write_, _execute_
			- For directories the three permissions have slightly different meanings:
				- _read_: allows the contents off the directory to be listed
				- _write_: allows the contents of the directory to be changed (i.e. filenames)
				- _execute_: allows access to files within the directory (permissions on the files themselves)
