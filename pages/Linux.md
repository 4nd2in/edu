# Linux
	- First Version was written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
	- The term Linux is commonly used to refer to the entire #UNIX like operating system of which the Linux #Kernel forms a part. However, this is something of a misnomer, since many of the key components contained within a typical commercial Linux distribution actually originate from a project that predates the inception of Linux by several years.
	- ## Users and Groups
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Users
			- Every user has a unique username and a user ID (UID). For each user, these are defined by a line in the system file `/etc/passwd`:
				- _Username_: the unique name of the user
				- _Password_: was used to store the encrypted password. Modern systems store `x` or `*` here, indicating the password is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file
				- _User ID (UID)_: the numeric ID associated with this user
				- _Group ID_ (GID): the numeric ID of the users primary group. additional groups are stored in the system group file.
				- _Home directory_: the initial directory into which the user is placed after logging in
				- _Login shell_: the name of the program to be executed to interpret user commands
			-
			- The superuser has special privileges in the system. His account has the user ID of 0 and the user name _root_. The superuser bypasses all permission checks in the system.
		- ### Groups
			- One user can be in multiple groups. Groups are made to easily administrate file access for multiple users. Each group is identified by a single line in the system group file `/etc/group`:
				- _Group name_: the unique name of the group
				- _Group ID_: the numeric ID associated with this group
				- _User list_: a comma-separated list of login names of users
