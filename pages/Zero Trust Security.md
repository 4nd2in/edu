- This is a security model that requires strict identity verification for every user and device trying to access resources on a private network. Compared to a traditional network, which trusts everyone in the network, this architecture trusts no one and nothing
- Zero Trust verifies user identity and privileges as well as device identity and security. Logins and connections time out periodically once established, forcing users and devices to be continuously re-verified. This added layer of security has been shown to prevent data breaches
- The main technology used for this architecture is [[ZTNA]]
