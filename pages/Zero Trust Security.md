- This is a security model that requires strict identity verification for every user and device trying to access resources on a private network. Compared to a traditional network, which trusts everyone in the network, this architecture trusts no one and nothing
- The main technology used for this architecture is [[ZTNA]]
- Zero Trust verifies user identity and privileges as well as device identity and security. Logins and connections time out periodically once established, forcing users and devices to be continuously re-verified. This added layer of security has been shown to prevent data breaches. The following principles are used to implement this architecture:
	- **Least Privillege**: Zero Trust uses the least-privilege principle. This means giving users only as much access as they need
	- **Device Access Control**: Zero Trust requires strict controls on device access. Zero Trust systems need to monitor how many different devices are trying to access their network, ensure that every device is authorised, and assess all devices to make sure they have not been compromised
	- Zero Trust utilises microsegmentation to keep different scopes of the network separate. A person or program with access to one of those zones will not be able to access any of the other zones without separate authorization
