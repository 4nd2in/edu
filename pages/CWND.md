- # Congestion Window (cwnd)
	- A #TCP state variable that is held by the sender and in contrary to the #[[RWND]] is not advertised.
	- The congestion window size is a sender-side limit on the amount of data the sender can have in flight before receiving an acknowledgment from the client
	- In [slow start congestion control]( ((64412696-09fb-49b5-b5de-f3d48f03232d)) ) #TCP increases the window's size rapidly to reach the maximum transfer rate as fast as possible. This self-imposed window size increases as #TCP confirms the network's ability to transmit the data without errors.
	- The maximum window size can not exceed the size of the #[[RWND]]
	- Originally, the start value was set to 1 network segment; RFC 2581 updated this value to 4 segments in April 1999; most recently the value was increased once more to 10 segments by RFC 6928 in April 2013.
