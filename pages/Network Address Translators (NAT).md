# NAT
	- This is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the [IP header]( ((6464998d-c562-4cca-aa7f-f315c069593a)) ) of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
	- This method was introduced as a response to the global IPv4 address exhaustion.
	- ## Basic NAT
		- In its simplest version (RFC RFC 2663) called basic NAT or one-to-one NAT only the IP addresses, IP header checksum and any higher-level checksums that include the IP Address are changed.
	- ## One-to-many NAT
		- The majority of network address translators map multiple private hosts to one publicly exposed IP address.
		- Here the routing device has one public and one private address.
		- As traffic passes through the router, it translates the source address in each packet from a private address to the router's public address. The router tracks basic data about each active connection (primarily destination address and port).
