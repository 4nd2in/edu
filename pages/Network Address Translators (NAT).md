- # NAT
	- This is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the [IP header]( ((6464998d-c562-4cca-aa7f-f315c069593a)) ) of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
	- This method was introduced as a response to the global IPv4 address exhaustion.

	- ## One-to-many NAT
