- # Internet Protocol (IP)
	- Is a [network layer (layer 3)]( ((64412719-7dde-4652-ae30-ed9ed4768876)) ) communication protocol for relaying #datagram across network boundaries.
	- This layer provides no guarantee about message delivery or notification of failure and hence directly exposes the unreliability to the layer above.
	- Each datagram is encapsulated within an IP packet which identifies the source and the destination addresses, as well as a number of other routing parameters.
