- # Internet Protocol (IP)
	- Is a [network layer (layer 3)]( ((64412719-7dde-4652-ae30-ed9ed4768876)) ) communication protocol for relaying #datagram across network boundaries.
	- This layer provides no guarantee about message delivery or notification of failure and hence directly exposes the unreliability to the layer above.
	- Each datagram is encapsulated within an IP packet which identifies the source and the destination addresses, as well as a number of other routing parameters.
	- ## RFC 791 - IPv4
		- 32 bit long addresses (maximum of 4.29 billion addresses)
		- Each address consists of numbers (0-255) concatenated with dots -> 192.168.1.1
		- #### IP Ranges
			- | IP address range
	- ## RFC 2460 - IPv6
