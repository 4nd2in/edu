- The way in which data is transmitted from one device to another device is known as transmission mode
- ## Simplex
	- Communication is only possible in one direction. One device is the sender, the other the receiver and that never changes
	- The advantage of using simplex mode is that the sender can use the transmission mediums full capacity
	- One example of a simplex mode is a radio station
- ## Half-duplex
	- Communication can happen in both directions but not simultaneously. It is like simplex but both ends can toggle between sender and receiver.
	- One example of a simplex mode is a walkie-talkie
- ## Full-duplex
	- Communication happens in both directions at the same time
	- One example of a full-duplex mode is a telephone network
	- The capacity of the transmission medium must be shared
