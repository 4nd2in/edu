# Types of multitasking
	- ## Preemptive
		- Processes are interrupted by the system and its resources are given to other processes. The system decides for how long the process should be executed before.
	- ## Coorporative
		- The system does not interrupt a process unexpectedly. Instead all processes must cooperate for the system to work. One process is able to halt the whole system.
