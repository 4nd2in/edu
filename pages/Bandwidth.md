- The backbones, or the fiber links, that form the core data paths of the Internet are capable of moving hundreds of terabits per second. However, the available capacity at the edges of the network is much, much less, and varies wildly based on deployed technology: dial-up, DSL, cable, a host of wireless technologies, fiber-to-the-home, and even the performance of the local router. The available bandwidth to the user is a function of the lowest capacity link between the client and the destination server
- Compared to #Latency there are multiple ways to improve #bandwidth. We can add more fibers into our fiber-optic links, we can deploy more links across the congested routes, or we can improve the WDM (wavelength-division multiplexing) techniques to transfer more data through existing links.
