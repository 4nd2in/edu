# What is a kernel
	- The kernel is the central software that manages and allocates computer resources (i.e., the CPU, RAM, and devices). It manages the limited resources of a computer. Hardware does not require a kernel to run applications, however it simplifies the writing and use of other programs.
	- Further information on this page refer mostly to #Linux and #UNIX kernels
	- ## Tasks performed by the kernel
		- ### Process scheduling
			- In a preemptive #multitasking operating system the kernel determines which process receives the use of the CPU and for how long.
		- ### Memory management
			- Like the CPU, RAM is a limited resource that the kernel must share among processes in an equitable and efficient fashion.
		- ### Provision of a [[file system]]
			- The kernel provides a file system on disk, allowing files to be created, retrieved, updated, deleted and so on.
		- ### Creation and termination of processes
			- The kernel can load a new process into memory, providing it with the resources that it needs to run.
		- ### Access to devices
			-
		- ### Networking
		- ### Provision of a system call API
