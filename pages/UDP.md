- # RFC 768 - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
	- Also referred to as *null protocol*
	- In comparison to #TCP this protocol does **not** provide
		- guaranteed message delivery
		- ordered delivery
		- connection state tracking
		- congestion control
	- Because of that, this protocol gives applications above the freedom to handle protocol design decisions themselves.
	- ## Header
		- This protocol delivers user messages in #datagram which are different to packets as they are not meant to be reliable.
		- UDP encapsulates user messages of the IP layer into its own packet structure which adds four fields
		  ![udp-header.png](../assets/udp-header_1684163111100_0.png)
		- ### Source Port (optional)
			- Indicates the port of the sending process and may be assumed to be the port to which a reply should be addressed in the absence of any other information. If unused, zero is inserted.
		- ### Destination Port (optional)
			- Indicates the port of the receiving process.
		- ### Length
			- Length  is the length  in octets  of this user datagram  including  this header  and the data. (This  means  the minimum value of the length is eight.)
		- ### Checksum (optional)
			- The #IP packet contains its own header checksum, and the application can choose to omit the UDP checksum, which means that all the error detection and error correction can be delegated to the applications above them.
